##  💡Inspiration
Hey 👋, all foodies!!
Let's say you want to cook something with what you have in your fridge, but you don't know what or how to cook. This is a pervasive problem for most of us. So we propose to save your precious time by providing you with a recommendation of foods you can cook and also by providing you a recipe for it.


##  ⚙️What it does
- Using Cohere AI we recommend foods based on your ingredients. This NLP-powered searching will 
  help you think about what you can do with what you have. Then you can choose your food and we will 
  provide you with the recipe using an API.

## 🛠️ How we built it
- We used Cohere AI to make the food generator which will take ingredients and tell you what you can 
   make from them.
- For Frontend, we use React js and TailwindCss for designing. 

## ⚠️ Challenges we ran into
- We were planning to use Wix, but we could implement it due to time and lack of experience. So we 
   had to change to react and nodejs and step away from Velo by Wix. We had a problem with mongoose 
   while trying to retrieve data from APIs.

## 👩‍💼🧑‍💻 Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We are proud to make this project functional and working to help foodies in a certain manner.
- We are immensely proud of achieving a good team contribution with each of the members has 
  contributed to the project in some way or other.

## ⚓ What we learned
- We learned about how to integrate or work with Cohere.
-  We learned many technologies and had experience working on them as well. Such as GitHub and the 
   GitHub pages were something we were introduced to for the first time.
